                </p>
                <p class="text1">In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight however only one face of
                    the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the
                    same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The side facing
                    away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>

                <p class="text1">There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon, The bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe.

                    A person would weigh much less on the Moon.

                <p class="text1">
                    The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller mass, so you would weigh about one sixth
                    (16.5%) of your weight on Earth. This is why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound so high in the
                    air.

                    The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission, while the
                    last man to walk on the Moon in 1972 was Gene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then the Moon has
                    only be visited by unmanned vehicles.

                <p class="text1">
                    This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from cosmic rays, meteorites and solar winds, and
                    has huge temperature variations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on the Moon, and the
                    sky always appears black.

                <p class="text1">
                    These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar astronauts used seismographs on their
                    visits to the Moon, and found that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the surface,
                    causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten core, just like Earth.
